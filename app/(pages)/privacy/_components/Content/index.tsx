Some information may also be retained for longer, e.g. where we are required to do so by law.</p>

                <p className="mb-[30px]">9.4 Anonymised data. In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we are entitled to retain and use such data without restriction.</p>
