Text needs more padding on the left, and Applications widget needs to either go over the edge a small amount or be contained with consistent padding





Community Hub button not properly contained in container





Spacing and sizing incorrect on the Research page hero section
Text needs to be moved up with the Blog & Research Posts pin, and PSTAKE icon needs to be corrected







All articles on the Mobile site have this grey outline around them and the Date and Read Time section divider has uneven spacing
